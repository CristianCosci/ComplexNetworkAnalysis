# **Link Prediction** :mag:
***Definition:*** :key:<br>
Link prediction finds missing links (in static networks) or predicts the likelihood of future links (in dynamic networks).

There exists a wide range of link prediction techniques like similarity-based indices, probabilistic methods, dimensionality
reduction approaches, etc.

# 1. **Introduction and Background**
A **social network** (a more general term is a complex network) is a standard approach to model communication in a group or community of persons. Such networks can be represented as a graphical model in which a node maps to a person or social entity, and a link corresponds to an association or collaboration between corresponding persons or social entities. When links can be deleted or added, during time, the network is called **dynamic**. Lots of issues arise when we study a social network,
some of which are changing association patterns over time, factors that drive those associations, and the effects of those associations to other nodes. Here, we address a specific problem termed as link prediction.

#### **Problem Characterization**
Consider a simple undirected network $G(V, E)$ (Refer to the Figure 1), where $V$ characterizes a vertex-set and $E$, the link-set.

We use (`vertex â‰¡ node`), (`link â‰¡ edge`) and (`graph â‰¡ network`) interchangeably. In the graph, a universal set $U$ contains a total of $\frac{n(nâˆ’1)}{2}$ links (total node-pairs), where $n = |V|$ represents the number of total vertices of the
graph. <br>
(|U| âˆ’ |E|) number of links are termed as the *non-existing links*, and some of these links may appear in the near future when we talk about dynamic network. ***Finding such missing links (i.e., AC, BD, and AD) is the aim of link prediction***.

The link prediction problem can be defined as follow:<br>
*Suppose a graph* $\mathit{G\_{t\_0 âˆ’ t\_1} (V, E)}$ *represents a snapshot of a network during time interval* $\mathit{[t_0 ,t_1]}$ *and* $\mathit{E_{t_0 âˆ’ t_1}}$ *, a set of links  present in that snapshot. The task of link prediction is to find set of links* $\mathit{E_{t_0' âˆ’ t_1'}}$ *during the time interval* $\mathit{[t_0' ,t_1']}$ *where* $\mathit{[t_0 ,t_1] \leq [t_0' ,t_1']}$ *.*

The link prediction idea is useful in several domains of application. Examples include automatic hyperlink creation, website hyper-link prediction in the Internet
and web science domain, and friend recommendation on Facebook.

# 2. **Existing methods** :bookmark_tabs:
Recently, numerous methodologies of link prediction have been implemented. These methods can be grouped into several categories, like **similarity-based, probabilistic models, learning-based models**, etc.
